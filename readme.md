PLC project, made on PLCNext and preliminary C++ codes for Dijkstra's Algorithm

PLCNext file is written on ST
3*4 grid, every square is a room.
Program lets you to choose a final node to travel, and Liam Neeson starts walking towards it

dijkstra_mul named scripts calculate multiple shortest routes to destination node

_unifuncs are just all functions in one main() body so it would be easier to implement to PLC(ST)
