a preliminary code for my PLC class project, a horror house game using Dijsktras Algorithm

dijkstra_mul named scripts calculate multiple shortest routes to destination node

_unifuncs are just all functions in one main() body so it would be easier to implement to PLC(ST)

wip:
calculating multiple shortest routes if they exist
